Problem B1: Watering Well - Chapter 1

Boss Rob just planted N happy little trees in his yard, which can be represented on a Cartesian plane.
The ith tree is located at coordinates ti=(Ai,Bi). Now,
he's looking for the best spot to build a well in order to provide water to them. He considers the inconvenience of a potential well location p to be the sum of the squared Euclidean distances to every tree:

∑i=1toN ∥p−ti∥^2

Rob wants to pick a location for his well, well... well.
Help him determine the inconvenience for Q different potential well locations, (X1,Y1),...,(XQ,YQ).
To reduce output size, please print the sum of inconveniences for all potential well locations, modulo 1,000,000,007.

Constraints:
1≤T≤55
1≤N,Q≤500,000
0≤Ai,Bi,Xi,Yi≤3,0000
All (Ai,Bi) are distinct within a given test case.
All (Xi,Yi) are distinct within a given test case.
The total sum of N and Q across all test cases is at most 3,000,000.


Input Format:
Input begins with a single integer T, the number of test cases. For each case, there is first a line containing a single integer N.
Then, N lines follow, the ith of which contains two space-separated integers Ai and Bi.
Then there is a line containing a single integer Q.
Then, Q lines follow, the ith of which contains two space-separated integers Xi and Yi.

Output Format:
For the ith test case, print a line containing "Case #i: ", followed by a single integer, the sum of inconveniences for all Q well locations, modulo 1,000,000,007.

Sample Explanation:
In the first case, the total inconvenience is 18+34=52:
	1.	For the well at (2,5), the inconvenience is the sum of the squared Euclidean distance to both trees, which is 3^2+3^2=18.
	2.	For the well at (6,6), the inconvenience is 32+2=34.

In the second case, the total inconvenience is 47+31+53=131:
	1.	For the well at (3,1), the inconvenience is 4+5+13+25=47.
	2.	For the well at (5,2), the inconvenience is 17+2+2+10=31.
	3.	For the well at (6,5), the inconvenience is 41+8+4+0=53.
