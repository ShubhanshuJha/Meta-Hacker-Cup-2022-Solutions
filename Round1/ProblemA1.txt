Problem A1: Consecutive Cuts - Chapter 1

Let's cut to the chase. You have a deck of N face-up cards, each displaying a unique integer between 1 and N.
Cutting the deck once consists of taking a stack of between 1 and N−1 (inclusive) cards from the top and moving it to the bottom in the same order.
For example, for the deck [5,1,2,4,3] ordered from top to bottom, cutting 2 cards from the top would yield [2,4,3,5,1].

Initially, the ith card from the top is Ai. Is it possible to cut the deck exactly K times to reorder the deck such that the ith card from the top is Bi for all i?

Constraints:
1≤T≤200
2≤N≤500,000
0≤K≤10^9
1≤Ai,Bi≤N
A and B are each permutations of 1..N1..N1..N.
The sum of NNN across all test cases is at most 5,000,0005{,}000{,}0005,000,000.

Input Format:
Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, there is first a line containing two space-separated integers N and K. Then, there is a line containing N space-separated integers, A1,...,AN.
Then, there is a line containing N space-separated integers, B1,...,BN.

Output Format:
For the ith test case, print "Case #i: " followed by "YES" if it's possible to cut the deck K times to change the deck from Ai to Bi, or "NO" otherwise.

Sample Explanation:
In the first case, it's possible to get to the new order with K=1 cut (cutting 2 cards from the top).

In the second case, it's impossible to change [3,1,4,2] to [1,2,3,4] with any number of cuts.

In the third case, it's impossible for the deck to be in a different order after K=0 cuts.


Sample Input:
4
5 1
5 1 2 4 3
2 4 3 5 1
4 10
3 1 4 2
1 2 3 4
4 0
3 1 4 2
2 3 1 4
3 3
3 2 1
1 3 2

Sample Output:
Case #1: YES
Case #2: NO
Case #3: NO
Case #4: YES
